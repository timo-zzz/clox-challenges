# clox-challenges
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) is a book about writing an interpreter for a programming language called Lox.<br>
The book is separated into chapters, and at the end of each chapter are 3 (I think?) challenges. The challenges can sometimes interfere with the implementation, so I wanted it to be its own repo (and not a branch either).
